# chain-ring

Just a quick scrobbler thing on the slow-mo video me and Ash took at MathsJam of the chain ring trick. (I think the hand is Will?) Scroll horizontally to send the ring up and down the chain.

Currently tested in Firefox and Chrome. Note that it's designed for natural-scrolling trackpads and touchscreens so it will feel a bit backwards on desktop (unless you come from a right-to-left reading culture in which case I don't know how you would normally expect this sort of thing to work).

I should probably warn you, at this framerate the 50Hz mains light flicker might act as a strobe. I've not had chance to clean that up yet.
