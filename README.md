# chain-ring

Just a quick scrobbler thing on the slow-mo video me and Ash took at MathsJam of the chain ring trick. (I think the hand is Will?) Scroll horizontally to send the ring up and down the chain.

Currently Firefox only because it's bedtime.

I should probably warn you, at this framerate the 50Hz mains light flicker might act as a strobe. I've not had chance to clean that up yet.
